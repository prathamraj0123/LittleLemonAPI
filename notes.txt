Since Week 4 'Project structure and API routes' and 'Peer graded assignment' don't match with eachother 100%. So below are few point that needs attention.

Point 1 (Peer) - The admin can assign users to the manager group. 
    So project is implemented such that manager is not able to assign users to manager group.

Point 2 (API routes) - Manager can perform CRUD on menuitem model.
    So project is implemented such that manager is able to perform CRUD.

Point 3 (API routes) - CUSTOMER -> POST: /api/orders
    To order item Customers can simply POST without including any detail. Order will be placed if cart has items.

Point 4 (Peer) - Customers can browse all the menu items at once. 
    It can be done using the below url and setting the limit to total items in menu. For example: total_menuitem is 16 at the moment so the url will be
                http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items?limit=16
   

Additional:
1) Djoser endpoints:
   a) /api/users/
   b) /api/users/me
   c) /api/token/login/

2) Category endpoints:
    a) /api/categories

3) For easier testing there is a url commented in project.urls. Using that will give access to login on browsable api view.

4) Throttling is commented in settings.py in project folder.

5) Session is commented in REST_FRAMEWORK in settings.py in project folder as instructed by the staff.
